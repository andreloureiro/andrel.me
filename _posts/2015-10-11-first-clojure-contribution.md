I started learning Clojure 3 months ago. I'm in love with the language!

As I've just started learning, I spent too many time of my day on [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org), a community powered documentation for Clojure.

And this week I made my first contribution to the Clojure community! I've included some examples and references (see also) for `inc'`.

You can check it out [here](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/inc')
