My name is Andre Loureiro and I'm a Frontend Developer, where I do some React.js, Angular and Node.

Actually I'm studying Functional Programming and I think this is improving myself as a developer. I'm also digging into Clojure and ClojureScript.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anlo_) or you can [email me](mailto:andreloureiroo@gmail.com) too.
