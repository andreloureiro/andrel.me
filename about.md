My name is Andre Loureiro and I'm a Frontend Developer living in Berlin. I work at [Zalando](https://zalando.de) where I do some UI interface development using React.js, Redux and Angular.

Actually I'm studying Functional Programming and I think this is improving myself as a developer. I'm also digging into Clojure and ClojureScript.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anlo_) or you can [email me](mailto:andreloureiroo@gmail.com) too.
